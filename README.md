## About The Project

I utilized the National Park Service's API to develop a website that retrieves and presents park data in a straightforward, filtered, and easily readable format. The data is fetched from both the client and server sides, adhering to a type-safe schema through the Zod validator. The park coordinates are integrated into the Leaflet JS map, an open-source tool, to visually represent their locations. To enhance my design system and wireframing skills, I employed Figma to create a functional prototype before entering the development phase. During development, I incorporated a new open-source component library called Shadcn UI, which not only expedited the process but also allowed for customization of components to align with my design system.

### Highlights

- Search for parks by state
- Access general information, including hours of operation, entrance fees, and associated costs for national parks
- Check current weather conditions and alerts
- Obtain directions, including driving routes, public transportation options, and GPS coordinates
- Implement TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation using Zod
- Utilize form validation with React Hook Form
- Explore the national park map location using the open-source Leaflet map
